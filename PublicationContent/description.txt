[h1]üìã Description[/h1]
Small server-side mutator that allows specified players to automatically login as an admin.

[h1]‚ùå Whitelisted?[/h1]
No. This mod is not whitelisted and will de-rank your server. Any XP earned will not be saved.

But I hope that it will be whitelisted - I submitted whitelist request here:

[h1]üñ•Ô∏è Usage (server)[/h1]
[b]Note:[/b] [i]If this is unclear, first read: [url=https://wiki.killingfloor2.com/index.php?title=Dedicated_Server_(Killing_Floor_2)][u]Dedicated Server Guide (KF2 wiki)[/u][/url][/i]
[olist]
[*]Open [b]PCServer-KFEngine.ini[/b] / [b]LinuxServer-KFEngine.ini[/b].
[*]Find [b][IpDrv.TcpNetDriver][/b] section and ensure line exists (add if missing):
[code]DownloadManagers=OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.SteamWorkshopDownload[/code]
(If there are several [b]DownloadManagers[/b] then the line above should be the first)
[*]Add the following string to the [b][OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.KFWorkshopSteamworks][/b] section (create one if it doesn't exist):
[code]ServerSubscribedWorkshopItems=2848836389[/code]
[*]Start server and wait for mutator download.
[*]When the download is complete, stop the server.
[*]Create a file [b](*)[/b]: [code]<kf2-server>\KFGame\Config\KFAAL.ini[/code]
with content:
[code][AAL.AAL]
Version=0[/code]
[*]Add mutator to server start parameters: [code]?Mutator=AAL.Mut[/code] and start the server (this will generate the default KFAAL.ini content).
[*]Stop the server and configure the mutator (see [b]‚öôÔ∏è Setup (KFAAL.ini)[/b] below).
[*]Start the server.

[h1]üêû (*) Buggy config initialization[/h1]
This mutator (like many others) relies on UnrealScript's default values (0 for int type) to detect first-time use and generate a config.
However, the game contains a bug that initializes unset values to random data, which can lead to incorrect settings or missing configs.

As a workaround, I recommend explicitly setting [b]Version=0[/b] in the config during the first initialization.

Unfortunately, I can't fix this issue because it's a game engine problem (not the mutator's fault).

[h1]‚öôÔ∏è Setup (KFAAL.ini)[/h1]
[list]
[*]Use [b]AdminId[/b] to set the list of admins, you can use UniqueID or SteamID. The default config contains example UniqueID and SteamID entries - replace them with the values ‚Äã‚Äãyou need or delete them, but don‚Äôt leave it as is.
[*]Set [b]bAutoEnableCheats=True[/b] to automatically enable cheats for admins.
[/list]

[h1]üîé Getting IDs[/h1]
You can view the Steam ID and UniqueID in WebAdmin on the PLAYERS tab:

But don't try to use the SteamID from here for EGS players - it won't work. SteamID is for Steam players only. UniqueID is suitable for all platforms.

SteamID can also be obtained from the player's profile, look at the URL:

If a player uses a nickname in a link to their profile, then add this to the profile url: [b]?xml=1[/b]

[h1]‚òëÔ∏è Status: Completed[/h1]
‚úîÔ∏è The mutator works with the current version of the game (v1150) and I have implemented everything I planned.
‚õîÔ∏è Development has stopped: I no longer have the time or motivation to maintain this mod. No further updates or bug fixes are planned.
