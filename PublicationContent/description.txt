[/list]

[h1]Getting ID[/h1]
You can view the Steam ID and UniqueID in WebAdmin on the PLAYERS tab:

But don't try to use the SteamID from here for EGS players - it won't work. SteamID is for Steam players only.
UniqueID is suitable for all platforms.

SteamID can also be obtained from the player's profile, look at the URL:

If a player uses a nickname in a link to their profile, then add this to the profile url: [b]?xml=1[/b]

[h1]Troubleshooting[/h1]
[b](*)[/b] If your config is not created for some reason, create it manually with the following content:
[b][AAL.AAL]
Version=0
[/b]

Then start the server and check the file again - config content should be generated.
