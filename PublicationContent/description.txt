[h1]Description[/h1]
Small server-side mutator that allows specified players to automatically login as an admin.

[h1]Whitelisted?[/h1]
[b]No.[/b] But I really hope that it will be whitelisted.

[b]⚠️ I submitted whitelist request here:[/b]

[h1]Usage (server)[/h1]
[b]Note:[/b] [i]If you don't understand what is written here, read the article [url=https://wiki.killingfloor2.com/index.php?title=Dedicated_Server_(Killing_Floor_2)][u]Dedicated Server (KF2 wiki)[/u][/url] before following these instructions.[/i]
[olist]
[*]Open your [b]PCServer-KFEngine.ini[/b] / [b]LinuxServer-KFEngine.ini[/b];
[*]Find the [b][IpDrv.TcpNetDriver][/b] section and make sure that there is a line (add if not):
[b]DownloadManagers=OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.SteamWorkshopDownload[/b]
❗️ If there are several [b]DownloadManagers=[/b] then the line above should be the first ❗️
[*]Add the following string to the [b][OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.KFWorkshopSteamworks][/b] section (create one if it doesn't exist):
[b]ServerSubscribedWorkshopItems=2848836389[/b]
[*]Start the server and wait until the mutator is downloading;
[*]Add mutator to server start parameters: [b]?Mutator=AAL.Mut[/b] and restart the server.
[/olist]

[h1]Important setup information[/h1]
The config should be created on first start, but now the game contains a bug that initializes the config values ​​randomly if they are not explicitly set. Thus, the config may have incorrect values ​​or not be created at all.
So if you are using this mutator for the first time, I highly recommend doing the following:
[olist]
[*]Create (modify) [b]KFAAL.ini[/b] manually. Put the following content there:
[b][AAL.AAL]
Version=0[/b]
[*]Start the game/server with AAL to generate the contents of the config.
[*]Close the game/server.
[/olist]
[b]Right now this is the only way to correctly create the default config.[/b]
Unfortunately I can't do anything about it because it's a game problem (not mutator). I hope TWI fixes this someday.

[h1]Setup (KFAAL.ini)[/h1]
[list]
[*]Use [b]AdminId[/b] to set the list of admins. You can use UniqueID or SteamID;
[*]Set [b]bAutoEnableCheats=True[/b] to automatically enable cheats for admins.
[/list]

[h1]Getting ID[/h1]
You can view the Steam ID and UniqueID in WebAdmin on the PLAYERS tab:

But don't try to use the SteamID from here for EGS players - it won't work. SteamID is for Steam players only.
UniqueID is suitable for all platforms.

SteamID can also be obtained from the player's profile, look at the URL:

If a player uses a nickname in a link to their profile, then add this to the profile url: [b]?xml=1[/b]
